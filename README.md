# Census-Income-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year using U.S. Census data. Key aspects include:
  - Data analysis of census data, including demographic features and income distribution.
  - Data preparation by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
  - Model building using various machine learning classifiers like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.
  - Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy score and classification reports to assess performance (e.g., Random Forest achieved ~84.5% accuracy).
    
This project applies different machine learning models and techniques to improve prediction accuracy of income classification.
